# Lunariens-Mental-Math-Trainer
Mental arithmetic trainer made in C#. Train your mental calculation speed with it!

# Usage
When you start the program, you have to enter a digit code. For more info about this, enter the word "help" instead of a digit code to get information about digit codes.

You will then be presented with a never-ending sequence of problems.
