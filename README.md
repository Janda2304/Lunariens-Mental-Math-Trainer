## In the program
When you start the program, you have to type the mode you want to use and then enter a digit code. For more info about this, enter the word "help" instead of a digit code to get information about digit codes.

You will then be presented with a never-ending sequence of problems.

# Capabilities
* Text to speech capabilities (!!)

# Plans
* Timing
* Statistics
* Custom averages (like average of 10 problems, of 5, and arithmetic means)
* Bigger number capabilities
* Bug fixes
* using multiple problem types in one training session
* bursts of problems (e. g. 10 problems at a time)

# Limitations
* The program currently only accepts single numbers for X and Y in the digit code.
* When entering a wrong answer, you don't get to try again. I will soon try to implement trying again.
